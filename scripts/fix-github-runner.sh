echo "   Make sure you have admin access to the repository"

# Step 2: Get runner registration token
echo "2. üîë Get a fresh registration token:"
echo "   a) Go to: https://github.com/Contaura/tuliocp/settings/actions/runners"
echo "   b) Click 'New self-hosted runner'"
echo "   c) Select 'Linux' and 'x64'"
echo "   d) Copy the token from the configuration command"

# Step 3: Alternative approach - use the GitHub CLI

# Create runner directory

echo "   # Payload URL: http://your-build-server:8080/build"
echo "   # Content type: application/json"
echo "   # Events: Push events"

# Step 6: Test runner

echo "   After setup, update .github/workflows/build-packages.yml:"

echo "7. üêõ Debugging Tips:"
echo "   - Ensure the repository is public or you have proper access"
echo "   - Check that Actions are enabled in repository settings"
echo "   - Verify the token hasn't expired (tokens expire after 1 hour)"
echo "   - Make sure you're using the correct repository URL format"
echo ""

echo "8. üìû Quick Test:"
echo "   curl -H \"Authorization: token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN\" \\"
echo "        https://api.github.com/repos/Contaura/tuliocp"
echo "   (This should return repository info, not 404)"

echo "üéØ Recommended Next Steps:"

echo "2. Try the manual setup commands above"
